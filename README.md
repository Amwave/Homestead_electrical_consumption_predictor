# Homestead_electrical_consumption_predictor
 A machine learning model to predict the electrical consumption of a city, Homestead, U.S
 
 This project implements an LSTM based deep learning model using tf
keras for prediction of hourly electrical consumption within a region
(city/state) using past electrical consumption data and weather data.
